# Alex to the Rescue!
CG1112 Engineering Principles and Practice II Final Project by Group B02-2A.

# Background (Adopted from Course Material)
72 hours. That is the "golden period" to locate and rescue survivors in the aftermath of
natural / manmade disasters such as earthquake, landslide and terrorist attack. Against the
ticking clock, rescuers have to brave incredible difficulties like rubbles / debris, narrow /
impassable passages and / or hazardous environment to look for any sign of life. Fortunately,
recent robotic advancement opens up many new possibilities for the rescue team.
